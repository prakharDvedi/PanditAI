Chapter 24: Effects of the Sun

1-3. If the Sun is in the Ascendant (Lagna), the native will have sparse hair, be lazy, of hot constitution, but scholarly and valorous. However, if the Sun is in Aries (Exalted), he will be wealthy and famous. If in Libra (Debilitated), he will be poor and dishonored.

4. Sun in the 2nd House: The native will be without wealth and devoid of learning. But if the Sun is aspected by Jupiter, he will be very wealthy and a learned speaker.

5. Sun in the 10th House: The native will be like a king, possessing elephants and horses (vehicles), wealthy, and brave. If connected with a Malefic, he will face obstacles in career.

6. Gajakesari Yoga: If Jupiter is in a Kendra (1, 4, 7, 10) from the Moon, the native destroys his enemies, becomes polite, and rules over a village or town.
